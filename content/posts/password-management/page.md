I recently engaged in a heated discussion on Reddit regarding my choice to continue using Google's "Sign in with Google" feature, despite my privacy concerns. The responses varied widely, with many users advocating for password managers instead. This blog post aims to clarify my stance on both options while addressing some vague claims that may have arisen during the discussion.

## The Great Password Manager Debate

In response to the suggestion of adopting password managers, I encountered skepticism. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of my perspective:

### 1. Security Quandaries
While password managers are often touted for their security, history has demonstrated that even reputable platforms like LastPass and 1Password have experienced significant breaches. Relying on a single service to store all your passwords can be a risky endeavor, as it centralizes your sensitive information in one location, making it a prime target for cybercriminals. This concern is valid for both password managers and SSO.

### 2. Self-Hosting Hurdles
Some advocate for self-hosting password managers as a solution to privacy concerns. However, this approach requires technical expertise and introduces additional security considerations and investments in infrastructure.

### 3. Syncing Woes
In our interconnected world, maintaining consistency across multiple devices is crucial. However, syncing passwords across platforms with a password manager can be cumbersome and prone to errors, leading to frustration.

### 4. Platform Compatibility
Not all password managers seamlessly integrate with every platform or browser. This lack of universal compatibility can result in inefficiencies and hinder daily usage.

### 5. Dependency Dilemma
I prioritize minimizing dependencies in my digital life. Each additional service introduces potential points of failure or vulnerability. Password managers inherently require reliance on another service, which contradicts my preference for simplicity and security.

## The Case for &quot;Sign in with Google&quot;

Conversely, opting for "Sign in with Google" presents compelling arguments:

### 1. Convenience
This feature simplifies the login process, alleviating the burden of managing numerous passwords and enhancing user convenience.

### 2. Autofill Mitigation
An often-overlooked aspect is that "Sign in with Google" does not autofill fields automatically, which mitigates the risk of related attacks. This adds a layer of security compared to password managers that may automatically fill in sensitive information.

### 3. Google Ecosystem
For users deeply entrenched in Google's ecosystem, relying on password managers may prove counterproductive and increase the attack surface.

## A Better Option?

Not widely adopted but [**SimpleLogin**](https://simplelogin.io/developer/) features SSO. This option offers enhanced privacy without the drawbacks associated with traditional password management or Google's sign-in feature.

## Conclusion

While password managers provide a seemingly more private solution by decentralizing authentication, they introduce various challenges and vulnerabilities. In contrast, "Sign in with Google" offers enhanced security and convenience due to its widespread adoption. Ultimately, the best choice depends on individual preferences and priorities regarding privacy and security.
