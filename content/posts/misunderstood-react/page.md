different people has different opinions for react, but its still a industry standard.
react aimed for efficient clientside frontend via VDOM and with hooks for easy reactivity

## the hate, people thinks its the wrong way and overkill

## VDOM

## some important hooks

## actual reason to hate

short sighted decision making and hitting devs by sudden changes
