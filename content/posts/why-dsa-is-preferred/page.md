Competitive coding (so called DSA these days) might not be needed for real world project or even if blurs the bigger picture sometime, by promoting  core optimization for a very niche scope there by scarifising some info which might be utilized later on. 

## what many prefers

- dev based task 
- which is good for checking if candidate can deliver the expected product
- this focuses on dev based skill


But don't you think companies already knows this.
And again anyone can be a good coder with a decent training.

## Why still DSA then?

- incase of acceptance anything is fine
- but what about rejection, what would you choose 
   - getting rejected after putting your efforts for days after final stage, which one cant even show off publicly or getting rejected after putting in efforts for couple of hours

- DSA question has automated validators, so no human input is needed. Making it fair, if the questions are attempted fairly.


- reviewing projects takes alot of time and man power 
  - which might hinder the process
  - not all projects will e properly viewed due to human nature
  - some other unexpected consequesnces and wrong decisions [these definitely happens with DSA too]

- another this it shows is how someone can handle situations / choices not in favour. If someones dont vouch for DSA but does good is a great sign.

- one more thing is companies needs to filter out candidates as muc as possible, which is easier with a more defined answers instead of projects created with different mind sets

- it still demonstrates problem solving ability, even if they may not occur in real world
